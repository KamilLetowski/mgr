Application of selected algorithms to optimize routes of municipal economy vehicles.}

Nowadays waste generated by residents is one of the problems that government have to deal with in Poland. Segregation and storage is not the only problem that can be encountered. Another difficulty that can be distinguished is their transport. The authors of the thesis proposed to conduct research to optimize vehicles routes acquired from the city of Bia{\l}ystok. Pawe{\l} Stypu{\l}kowski presented proposals for solving the problem using a genetic algorithm. On the other hand, Kamil {\L}{"e}towski explored the topic of route optimization using the ant algorithm in more detail. Where the final optimization solutions were presented by Przemys{\l}aw Noskowicz with greedy algorithms. After the theoretical introduction, the data sets on which the algorithms worked were presented. Next, the results that have been achieved with a particular solution are shown. There was also a list and comparison of the best achievements.
